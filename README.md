Learning Shell Scripting with AWS

Overview

This repository documents my journey of learning shell scripting with AWS, primarily based on the book Mastering Linux Shell Scripting (2nd Edition) by Mokhtar Ebrahim. My approach involves learning concepts from the book and applying them in real-world AWS automation tasks.

Learning Approach

Concepts from the Book: Studying each chapter and understanding scripting fundamentals.

Practical Application: Implementing AWS-specific scripting tasks to reinforce learning.

Iterative Improvement: Refining scripts based on best practices and new learnings.

Topics Covered

Linux shell scripting basics

Conditional statements and loops

Functions and script organization

File handling and process management

Error handling and logging

Working with AWS CLI for automation

AWS Integration

As part of the learning process, I apply shell scripting to AWS services, focusing on:

Automating EC2 instance management (start, stop, terminate, status checks)

S3 bucket operations (creating, listing, syncing, and deleting)

IAM user and role management

CloudWatch monitoring and alert automation

Lambda function invocation via shell scripts
